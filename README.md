Fun with API!!!
THIS APP IS BASED ON USING GIFY API.
I HAVE USED JQUERY LIBRRY IN CODING THIS.
THIS CODE BASICALLY HAS 3 FILES NAMELY:HTML(index.html),CSS(style.css&reset.css) AND JAVASCRIPT(gif.js).
THE THEME USED IS GETTING IMAGES OF MUSICIANS DYANAMICALLY BY USING GIFY API.
ON CLICK OF THESE DYANAMICALLY CREATED  BUTTONS OF MUSICIANS WE GET THE IMAGES.
ANIMATION OF IMAGES WAS ALSO ACHIEVED DYNAMICALLY WHICH ON CLICK EITHER GIVES STILL IMAGE OR ELSE GIVES AN ANIMATED ONE.

THE CHALLENGE WAS ENCOUNTERED WHILE ANIMATING THE STILL IMAGES.
